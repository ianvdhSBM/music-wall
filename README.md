## Music Wall

### Lighthouse Labs - Week 4 project

Our first Sinatra-based app.

I learned how to:

- implement **users** and remember them with **sessions**

- allow users to have **profile pages** that list all of their songs and reviews

- implement a **one-to-many** database for list all users or all songs and their reviews

- use a (rudimentary) **Upvote system**

- add **Materialize CSS** properties
